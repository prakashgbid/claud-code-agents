# Agent Hierarchy System

Autonomous multi-agent orchestration framework for parallel execution and self-healing operations.

## Architecture Overview

### Three-Layer Hierarchy
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Chief Product Manager  │  Layer 1: Executive
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │
    ┌────────┴────────┐
    ▼                 ▼        Layer 2: Leads
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐   (Architect, Operations,
│  LEADS  │ ... │  LEADS  │    Quality, Delivery)
└────┬────┘     └────┬────┘
     │                │
    ▼                ▼        Layer 3: Specialists
[SPECIALISTS]   [SPECIALISTS]  (40+ domain experts)
```

## Parallel Execution Engine

### Workstream Distribution
```javascript
async function executeVision(vision) {
  const workstreams = decomposeVision(vision);
  
  // Launch all leads in parallel
  const results = await Promise.all([
    architectLead.design(workstreams.technical),
    operationsLead.prepare(workstreams.infrastructure),
    qualityLead.validate(workstreams.testing),
    deliveryLead.implement(workstreams.features)
  ]);
  
  return synthesizeResults(results);
}
```

### Concurrency Model
- **Inter-Lead**: All leads work simultaneously
- **Intra-Team**: Specialists within teams work in parallel
- **Cross-Team**: Async message passing for dependencies
- **Batch Operations**: Group similar tasks for efficiency

## Self-Healing Mechanisms

### Automatic Recovery Patterns
1. **Retry with Backoff**: Transient failures
2. **Alternative Approach**: Method failures
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Partial failures
4. **Rollback and Retry**: State corruption
5. **Escalation Path**: Unrecoverable errors

### Failure Detection
```yaml
monitors:
  - progress_tracking: 30s intervals
  - health_checks: Continuous
  - output_validation: After each step
  - dependency_resolution: Real-time

triggers:
  - no_progress: 5 minutes
  - error_rate: >10%
  - quality_threshold: <80%
  - deadline_risk: 20% buffer
```

## Communication Protocols

### Message Types
- **Vision**: High-level requirements
- **Assignment**: Task delegation
- **Status**: Progress updates
- **Handoff**: Inter-team transfers
- **Escalation**: Critical issues

### Routing Rules
```
User ←→ Chief PM (bidirectional)
Chief PM → Leads (unidirectional delegation)
Leads ←→ Specialists (bidirectional within team)
Leads ←→ Leads (async coordination)
```

## Lead Orchestrators

### Architect Lead
- **Domain**: System design, technical decisions
- **Agents**: backend-architect, frontend-developer, solution-architect, etc.
- **Authority**: Technical veto power

### Operations Lead  
- **Domain**: Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring
- **Agents**: devops-automator, infrastructure-maintainer, etc.
- **Authority**: Production access control

### Quality Lead
- **Domain**: Testing, compliance, security
- **Agents**: test-writer-fixer, api-tester, legal-compliance-checker, etc.
- **Authority**: Release gate control

### Delivery Lead
- **Domain**: Sprint planning, feature delivery
- **Agents**: rapid-prototyper, sprint-prioritizer, project-shipper, etc.
- **Authority**: Timeline decisions

## Conflict Resolution

### Decision Matrix
| Conflict Type | Primary Authority | Secondary | Override |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| Technical Design | Architect Lead | Quality Lead | Chief PM |
| Resource Allocation | Chief PM | - | User |
| Timeline vs Quality | Delivery Lead | Quality Lead | Chief PM |
| Security Issues | Quality Lead | - | No Override |

### Resolution Strategies
1. **Automated Negotiation**: Leads find compromise
2. **Priority-Based**: Higher priority wins
3. **Round-Robin**: Equal distribution
4. **Escalation**: Chief PM decides
5. **User Override**: Only for critical decisions

## Performance Optimization

### Parallelization Rules
- Identify independent tasks
- Batch similar operations
- Pipeline sequential dependencies
- Cache shared computations
- Preemptive resource allocation

### Efficiency Metrics
```yaml
targets:
  parallel_efficiency: >85%
  decision_latency: <30s
  handoff_time: <1min
  error_recovery: <5min
  completion_rate: 100%
```

## Implementation Guide

### Activation Sequence
```bash
# 1. Initialize hierarchy
claude-code --init-hierarchy

# 2. Configure leads
claude-code --configure-leads

# 3. Map specialists
claude-code --map-specialists

# 4. Enable self-healing
claude-code --enable-recovery

# 5. Start orchestration
claude-code --start-orchestration
```

### Integration Points
- Version control systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Project management tools
- Communication platforms
- Monitoring systems

## Best Practices

### DO
- Provide clear vision statements
- Set measurable success criteria
- Trust autonomous decisions
- Monitor aggregate metrics
- Document patterns that work

### DON'T
- Micromanage individual agents
- Interrupt mid-execution
- Override without strong reason
- Skip escalation paths
- Ignore systematic failures

## Advanced Features

- Spawn additional specialists for bottlenecks
- Merge duplicate work automatically
- Load balance across available agents

### Learning System
- Track successful patterns
- Optimize common workflows
- Share knowledge across projects
- Improve over time

### Cross-Project Coordination
- Share resources between projects
- Reuse successful architectures
- Maintain consistent standards
- Coordinate releases
