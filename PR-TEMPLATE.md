# Pull Request: Enterprise-Level Agents for Complete SDLC

## Summary
This PR adds 7 new enterprise-level agents across 4 new departments to enable complete software development lifecycle management, from requirements gathering to knowledge preservation.

## What's New

### üè¢ New Departments (4)
1. **Enterprise Architecture** - Cross-project governance and reusability
2. **Business Analysis** - Requirements and product management  
3. **Agile Delivery** - Sprint execution and automation
4. **Knowledge Management** - Documentation and learning

### ü§ñ New Agents (7)
- `enterprise-architect` - Manages cross-project architecture patterns
- `solution-architect` - Designs end-to-end compliant solutions
- `business-analyst` - Gathers requirements and creates user stories
- `product-owner` - Owns product vision and prioritization
- `jira-automation` - Automates ticket management and reporting
- `scrum-master` - Facilitates agile ceremonies and coaching
- `knowledge-curator` - Captures and shares organizational knowledge

## Why These Additions?

The original agents excel at rapid development within projects, but enterprises need:
- **Requirements Management**: Clear path from business need to implementation
- **Architecture Governance**: Consistency and reusability across projects
- **Project Automation**: Jira integration for tracking and reporting
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Learning capture for continuous improvement

## Complete Workflow Enabled

```
Business Need ‚Üí Business Analyst ‚Üí Product Owner ‚Üí Solution Architect 
‚Üí Enterprise Architect ‚Üí Development (existing agents) ‚Üí Jira Automation 
‚Üí Scrum Master ‚Üí Delivery ‚Üí Knowledge Curator ‚Üí Continuous Improvement
```

## Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Standardization** - Consistent patterns across all projects  
‚úÖ **Traceability** - Requirements to delivery tracking  
‚úÖ **Automation** - Reduced manual project management  
‚úÖ **Reusability** - Shared components and libraries  
‚úÖ **Knowledge Sharing** - Documented patterns and lessons  

## Testing
All agents have been:
- Structured with proper YAML frontmatter
- Given comprehensive system prompts (500+ words)
- Provided with detailed usage examples
- Configured with appropriate tool access

## Impact
- **Backward Compatible**: No changes to existing agents
- **Additive Only**: New departments don't affect current structure
- **Optional Usage**: Teams can adopt enterprise agents gradually

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Gather requirements for new feature
"Use the business-analyst to create user stories"

# Design scalable architecture
"Have the solution-architect design our microservices"

# Automate project tracking
"Use jira-automation to create sprint reports"

# Preserve knowledge
"Ask the knowledge-curator to document our patterns"
```

## Future Considerations
- Integration with specific Jira instances
- Industry-specific compliance agents
- Multi-cloud architecture agents
- Security and DevSecOps agents
