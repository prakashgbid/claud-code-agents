# Enterprise Agent Additions

## Overview
Added 7 new enterprise-level agents across 4 new departments to enable complete software development lifecycle management with proper requirements gathering, architecture governance, and knowledge management.

## New Departments & Agents

### 1. Enterprise Architecture (`enterprise-architecture/`)
- **enterprise-architect** - Cross-project architecture design, reusable components, and technology standardization
- **solution-architect** - End-to-end solution design, compliance alignment, and cost optimization

### 2. Business Analysis (`business-analysis/`)
- **business-analyst** - Requirements gathering, user story creation, and business process modeling
- **product-owner** - Product vision, backlog prioritization, and release planning

### 3. Agile Delivery (`agile-delivery/`)
- **jira-automation** - Automated ticket management, workflow automation, and sprint reporting
- **scrum-master** - Sprint facilitation, impediment removal, and team coaching

### 4. Knowledge Management (`knowledge-management/`)
- **knowledge-curator** - Documentation, cross-project learning, and best practices

## Key Capabilities

### Requirements to Delivery Flow
1. Business Analyst gathers and documents requirements
2. Product Owner prioritizes and creates roadmap
3. Solution Architect designs technical solution
4. Enterprise Architect ensures alignment and reusability
5. Jira Automation manages tickets and tracking
6. Scrum Master facilitates delivery
7. Knowledge Curator captures lessons learned

### Enterprise Benefits
- **Standardization**: Consistent patterns across all projects
- **Reusability**: Shared component libraries and templates
- **Traceability**: Requirements to delivery tracking
- **Automation**: Jira integration and workflow automation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Documented patterns and lessons learned

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Requirements gathering
"Use the business-analyst to create user stories for the new feature"

# Architecture design
"Have the solution-architect design our microservices architecture"

# Project management
"Use jira-automation to create sprint reports"

# Knowledge management
"Ask the knowledge-curator to document our deployment patterns"
```

## Integration with Existing Agents

These enterprise agents complement the existing studio agents by adding:
- Strategic planning and governance layer
- Requirements management capabilities
- Cross-project coordination
- Knowledge preservation mechanisms
- Enterprise-scale automation

## Metrics & KPIs

The enterprise agents help track:
- Requirements coverage and traceability
- Architecture reusability metrics
- Sprint velocity and predictability
- Knowledge documentation coverage
- Cross-project component usage
